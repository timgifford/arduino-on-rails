This repo is an attempt to hook up an arduino to a LocoNet network using
the LocoNet Sheild and libraries from Alex Shepard.

I was able to read from the LocoNet, but was unable to send messages to
LocoNet.

In order for the .ino files to work in the Arduino IDE, you need to copy
the lib\LocoNet files to your local Arduino\Library directory. After
copying the files, you should see the LocoNet library in the Arduino
IDE.
